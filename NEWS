--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SpearKarb, ReedMuench, and DragBehr will enforce that input data is sorted by x (either increasing or decreasing). No estimate will be calculated.
* SpearKarb, ReedMuench, and DragBehr will evaluate if input data y variable is not monotone and display results as a warning. The estimate will be calculated in the original order regardless of direction.
* For Y variables that are monotone, SpearKarb, ReedMuench, and DragBehr will evaluate whether input is monotone increasing or monotone decreasing and display results as a message. The estimate will be calculated in the original order regardless of direction.
* examples of unordered X variable, X variable direction, Y variable direction, Y variable not monotone added to SpearKarb, ReedMuench, and DragBehr help pages


skrmdb 4.2.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* add checks to SpearKarb for input data to be monotone increasing
